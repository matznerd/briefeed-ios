# UI Freeze - Final Fix Implementation

## Problem Summary
The app was experiencing complete UI freeze with "Publishing changes from within view updates" errors and hang detections every 0.5 seconds.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Continuous Polling Timer** ⚠️
- `AppViewModel.startPolling()` was running a timer every 0.5 seconds
- Each tick was calling `syncState()` which updated multiple @Published properties
- This caused continuous UI updates and freeze cycles

### 2. **Direct Singleton Access During Queue Operations**
- `QueueServiceV2.syncToAudioService()` was directly accessing `BriefeedAudioService.shared`
- Called immediately when adding items to queue
- Triggered state changes during UI update cycle

### 3. **Multiple ObservableObject Singletons**
- Already fixed in previous iteration but still contributing to the problem

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Disabled Polling Timer ✅
```swift
private func startPolling() {
    // DISABLED: Polling causes continuous UI updates and freezes
    return
}
```

### 2. Implemented Proper Combine Subscriptions ✅
- Replaced polling with reactive subscriptions
- Added throttling to prevent excessive updates:
  - Audio state changes: 100ms throttle
  - Time updates: 1 second throttle
  - Queue changes: 100ms throttle
- Used `removeDuplicates()` to prevent unnecessary updates

### 3. Deferred Queue Synchronization ✅
```swift
// Instead of immediate sync:
await syncToAudioService() // ❌ Causes freeze

// Now using deferred sync:
scheduleDeferredSync(delay: 0.5) // ✅ Runs after UI update cycle
```

- Added timer-based deferred sync mechanism
- Sync runs on background thread: `Task.detached(priority: .background)`
- Prevents state changes during UI updates

## Code Changes

### AppViewModel.swift
- Disabled `startPolling()`
- Added `setupCombineSubscriptions()` with proper throttling
- Subscriptions only update when values actually change

### QueueServiceV2.swift
- Added `scheduleDeferredSync()` method
- Added `performDeferredSync()` for background execution
- Replaced all direct `syncToAudioService()` calls with deferred version
- Initial load sync delayed by 2 seconds

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build succeeds
- [ ] App launches without freezing
- [ ] No hang detection warnings
- [ ] UI remains responsive while scrolling
- [ ] + button works to add articles to queue
- [ ] No "Publishing changes from within view updates" errors
- [ ] Audio controls remain functional

## Architecture Pattern

```
User Interaction
    ↓
View Update Request
    ↓
State Change (deferred if needed)
    ↓
Combine Subscription (throttled)
    ↓
UI Update (batched)
```

## Key Lessons

1. **Never use timers for continuous state polling in SwiftUI**
2. **Always defer operations that might trigger state changes**
3. **Use Combine with proper throttling for reactive updates**
4. **Background operations should use Task.detached**
5. **Test for UI responsiveness, not just functionality**

## Next Steps

Once confirmed working:
1. Re-enable queue synchronization with proper implementation
2. Consider removing ObservableObject from all singleton services
3. Implement proper dependency injection pattern
4. Add performance monitoring for UI updates
