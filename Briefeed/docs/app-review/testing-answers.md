  Questions & Gaps to Address:

  1. Environment Configuration

  - How will API keys be managed for testing? Consider:
    - Separate test API keys vs production keys
    - CI/CD environment variable setup
    - Key rotation strategy for tests

    lets not focus on the test key as the user is giving it right now and later on yes, we will do it remotely


  2. Test Data Management

  - What's the strategy for test data that won't trigger content filters?
  just show maybe a response code of content filtered due to LLM provider, sorry, or something along those lines
  - How will you handle testing with different content lengths (edge cases)?
  should be fine, as google context window is 1m tokens and no site has that big
  - Need fixtures for various article types (news, technical, opinion pieces)
  fixtures why?

  3. Performance Benchmarks

  - What are acceptable response times for each API?
  it is what it is for now, but some feedback to the user if we have any would be good
  - How will you measure and track performance degradation?
  what would degreat?
  - Memory usage limits for audio processing?
  something very generous and only that would catch in an error?

  4. Failure Scenarios

  - Network timeout handling tests?
  yes good to have some errors ways to know stuff is not working for dev and user
  - Partial response handling (connection drops mid-stream)?
  note something, like try again
  - Malformed response handling beyond just error codes?
  

  5. API Contract Versioning

  - How will you detect when APIs change versions?
  i am followimg the updates, these are stable and good for a long time
  - Strategy for testing against multiple API versions during transitions?
  don't worry for now
  - Automated alerts for deprecation notices in response headers?
  its fine for now to skip this

  6. Security Testing

  - API key exposure prevention tests?
  lets skip this for now
  - Certificate pinning validation?
  - Man-in-the-middle attack prevention?
deal with alter


  7. Load Testing Details

  - Concurrent request limits?
  just make sure not bugging
  - Queue overflow scenarios?
  - Background task scheduling conflicts?

  8. Platform-Specific Considerations

  - iOS background mode restrictions?
  - App suspension/resume during API calls?
  - Low power mode behavior?

  9. Monitoring & Alerting
  ignore for now while esitng


  - What metrics will trigger alerts?
  - Where will monitoring data be stored?
  - Who gets notified when tests fail?
  
  10. Rollback Strategy
lets just get the code stable and working then focus on this, using git for now
  - How to handle API breaking changes in production?
  - Feature flags for API version switching?
  - Graceful degradation plan?
