# Next Steps - Audio Migration Testing

## ‚úÖ What's Complete

1. **Build Successfully Compiles** - All compilation errors fixed
2. **New Audio System Implemented** - BriefeedAudioService with SwiftAudioEx
3. **Feature Flags Added** - Safe rollout mechanism in place
4. **UI Components Created** - MiniAudioPlayerV2 and ExpandedAudioPlayerV2
5. **Backward Compatibility** - AudioServiceAdapter maintains old API

## üöÄ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Open Xcode and Run the App
```bash
cd /Users/me/ericode/briefeed-app/briefeed-ios/Briefeed
open Briefeed.xcodeproj
```
- Select iPhone 16 Pro simulator
- Press Cmd+R to build and run

### 2. Test Live News (Priority #1)
This was the original issue - RSS audio throwing AVAudioSession error -50

**Steps:**
1. Go to Live News tab
2. Add an RSS podcast feed (if needed)
3. Tap "Play Live News" button
4. **Check if error -50 is resolved**

### 3. Test Basic Audio Playback
1. Go to Feed tab
2. Select any article
3. Tap Play button
4. Verify TTS generation works
5. Check mini player appears

### 4. Enable New Audio System
Look in Settings for feature flag toggle to switch between old and new audio systems.

## üîç What to Watch For

**Success Signs:**
- Live News plays without crashing
- No AVAudioSession error -50
- Audio plays smoothly
- Mini player shows progress
- Background audio works

**Potential Issues:**
- Feature flag UI might not be visible (check Settings)
- TTS might need Gemini API key configured
- Some tests don't compile (expected, will fix after manual testing works)

## üìä Testing Priority

1. **Live News/RSS Playback** - Verify original issue is fixed
2. **Article TTS Playback** - Core functionality
3. **Queue Persistence** - Critical for user experience
4. **Background Audio** - Important for podcast experience

## üêõ If Things Don't Work

1. **Check Console Output** - Look for error messages
2. **Toggle Feature Flag** - Try old vs new system
3. **Verify API Keys** - Gemini API key in Settings
4. **Clear App Data** - Delete app and reinstall

## üìù Feedback Needed

After testing, please confirm:
- Does Live News play without error -50?
- Does basic audio playback work?
- Any crashes or unexpected behavior?
- Feature flag visible and working?

---

**The build compiles successfully. Now we need to verify it actually works in practice!**

The most critical test is whether Live News/RSS audio now plays without the AVAudioSession error -50 that started this whole migration.
